Title: Introduction to UVM Connect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group: Overview

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The UVM Connect library provides TLM1 and TLM2 connectivity between
SystemC and SystemVerilog models and components. It also provides a
UVM Command API for accessing and controlling UVM simulation from
SystemC (or C or C++).

(see UVMC_Overview_1.png)



Topic: Purpose
--------------

UVM Connect enables the following use models, all designed to maximize IP reuse.

Abstraction Refinement - Reuse your SC architectural models as reference
       models in SV verification.

Expansion of VIP Inventory - More off-the-shelf VIP is available when
       you are no longer confined to VIP written in the language of your
       testbench.

Leveraging each language - Each language has its strengths. You can
       leverage SV's powerful constraint solvers and UVM's sequences to
       provide random stimulus to your SC architectural models. And you
       can leverage SC's speed and capacity for verification of untimed
       or loosely timed system-level environments.

Direct access to UVM - The UVM Command API
       provides a means to wait for UVM phase transitions, raise and
       drop objections to phase transitions, set and get configuration,
       issue UVM-formatted reports, set report filters, print UVM
       topology, set factory overrides by instance and type, and more.

The UVM Connect library makes connecting TLM models in SystemC and UVM
in SystemVerilog a relatively straightforward process. However, because
UVM Connect is effectively integrating several technologies, you'll need
to have basic knowledge of SystemC, SystemVerilog, and the UVM, and TLM
standards. Refer to the <References> section for a partial list of
relevant documentation. You may also wish to read the brief <TLM Review>
included in this documentation. 



Topic: Key Features
-------------------

This section enumerates some important characteristics of UVM Connect.

Simplicity - Object-based data transfer is accomplished with very little
             preparation needed by the user. 

Optional   - The UVM Connect library is provided as a separate, optional
             package to UVM. You do not need to import the package if your
             environment does not require cross-language TLM connections or
             access to the UVM Command API.

Works with Standard UVM - UVM Connect works with the free, open-source
             Accellera UVM 1.1a and later. With a small modification,
             UVM Connect can work with previous UVM open-source releases.

Enhances native modeling methodology - UVM Connect does not impose a foreign
             methodology nor require your models or transactions to inherit
             from a base class. Your TLM models can fully exploit the features
             of the language in which they are written.

Supports existing models - Your existing TLM models in both SystemVerilog and
             SystemC can be reused in a mixed-language context without
             modification.

Reinforces TLM modeling standards - The UVM Connect reinforces the principles
             and purpose of the TLM interface standard--enabling independently
             designed models to communicate without directly referring to each other.
             Such models become highly reusable. They can be integrated in both
             native and mixed-language environments without modification.
             See <TLM Review> for an introduction to TLM concepts and principles.


Topic: Definitions
------------------

Definitions for terms used throughout this document.

SV  - Short for SystemVerilog, or UVM in SystemVerilog. The context
      will make clear which. In figures, UVM SV components are shown
      in shades of blue.

SC  - Short for SystemC. In figures, SC components are shown in shades of yellow.

model - Functionality encapsulated by a class. A model is typically a
      subtypes (derived from) of ~sc_module~ in SC and ~uvm_component~
      in SV. Although dynamic in nature, models deriving from these classes
      are quasi-static; they are created during elaboration of the testbench
      and continue to exist throughout simulation. 

component - Synonymous with ~model~, above.

hierarchical component - A model that contains one or more models. The
      hierarchical component is often referred to as the ~parent~ of the
      sub-components, which are referred to as its ~children~.


See <TLM Review> for definitions of TLM-related concepts and terms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group: Getting Started

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section specifies the requirements for compiling and using the UVMC
library and included examples.



Topic: UVM Requirements
-----------------------

The latest UVM version requirements

  UVM           - 1.1a or later

The latest version of UVM can be downloaded from Accellera.
(http://www.accellera.org/activities/committees/vip)

UVM 1.1a adds a simple accessor method to uvm_port_base #(IF) for
getting the interface mask of the port that is required by UVMC:

| 376a374,377
| >   function int m_get_if_mask();
| >     return m_if_mask;
| >   endfunction

You can enable UVM 1.0p1 or UVM-1.1 to work with UVM Connect by added this
method to the uvm_port_base #(IF) class in ~UVM_HOME/src/base/uvm_port_base.svh~.
Either make the edit as above directly in your source, or replace the
source file with the one included the ~UVM_HOME/compatibility~ directory
in this kit. No other changes have occurred in this file between UVM 1.0p1
and 1.1a, so it is OK to replace the whole file.




Topic: Simulator Requirements
-----------------------------

The latest simulator requirements

  Mentor Questa - 10.1 or later.
                  The UVMC library will work with 10.0d and later provided
                  your UVM_LIB and UVMC_LIB environment variables point to
                  the same location (which they do by default) and you
                  recompile the UVM and UVMC libraries as described in
                  <Compiling Libraries>.
  Synopsys VCS  - unknown
  Cadence IUS   - unknown

UVMC is intended to work with all simulators--it uses standard SV, using
only DPI-C behind the scenes. However, there are likely some simulator-specific
limitations or differences that would prevent out-of-box compilation on
non-Questa tools, and Mentor is only able to qualify on Questa. Users of
other tools are encouraged to try to compile UVMC and report back anything
we can do to make the library more portable, to the extent allowed by your
license agreements and NDAs with those vendors.



Topic: Platform Requirements
----------------------------

The latest platform requirements

  Mentor Questa - At present, only Linux 32 and 64-bit platforms are
                  supported. Specific OS and version support is the
                  same as with Questa.
  Synopsys VCS  - unknown
  Cadence IUS   - unknown



Topic: Env Setup
----------------

How to prepare your environment

To run any example, you need compiled UVM and UVMC libraries.
Precompiled libraries for Questa 1.1 for 32 and 64-bit Linux are
included at the default location ($UVMC_HOME/lib), so this
step is not necessary if you are running Questa 1.1 on Linux.

The following environment variables should be set before compiling the
UVM and UVMC libraries (if needed), and before running the examples
included in this kit.

PATH -      Your simulator should be included in your PATH and meet
            the minimum version requirements stated earlier. If you
            need to (or plan to) compile the UVM Connect and/or UVM
            libraries, your path must also point to a GCC compiler
            supported by the simulator. Refer to your simulator
            documentation for such requirements.

UVM_HOME -  The location of the UVM source distribution that meets
            the minimum version requirements. See <UVM Requirements>
            for details. This path is needed for compiling the
            UVM library, and for locating the ~uvm_macros.svh~ file
            when compiling the examples. 

UVMC_HOME - The location of the UVMC library source. This is needed 
            when compiling the UVMC library from outside the install
            directory. It is also needed for locating the UVMC's SC
            headers and SV's uvmc_macros.svh when compiling the examples.

UVM_LIB -   Specifies the location to put the compiled UVM library
            Default: ~$UVMC_HOME/lib/uvmc_lib~

UVMC_LIB -  Specifies the location to put the compiled UVMC library
            Default: ~$UVMC_HOME/lib/uvmc_lib~


The UVMC library is intended to be portable across all simulators.
If you had to make changes to the UVMC library source to accommodate your
simulator, please let Mentor know via
Verification Academy (http::/verificationacademy.com), your 
field representative(s), or Mentor's general support line.

If you have a writable installation of the UVMC kit, you can
compile the libraries and examples directly within the UVMC tree. In this
case, you only need to specify the UVM_HOME environment variable.

It is possible to override the environment variable settings via Makefile
arguments of the same name.  This is not recommended because it will be
easy to inadvertently compile libraries and examples using different paths.

The following statements set the four environment variables. For convenience,
you may wish to put these in a setup script or in your .cshrc / .profile.

  | > setenv UVM_HOME <path to UVM 1.1a>
  | > setenv UVMC_HOME <path to UVMC install dir>
  | > setenv UVM_LIB $UVMC_HOME/lib/uvmc_lib
  | > setenv UVMC_LIB $UVM_LIB



Topic: Compiling Libraries
--------------------------

How to compile the UVM and UVMC libraries

Compiled UVM and UVMC libraries are required before you can run
the examples.  Compilation is done separately from the examples in
accordance with standard practice.

This kit provides a Makefile in $UVMC_HOME/lib for compiling the UVM and
UVMC libraries. It is geared toward Questa compilation, so it will need
to be adapted for use with other simulators.  Please note the following:

- This kit provides a precompiled UVM 1.1a and UVMC library for Questa 1.1
Linux 32 and 64-bit. For this platform/simulator combination, you should
be able to skip this section and go straight to running the examples.

- Before you attempt to compile, be sure you have prepared your environment
as described in <Env Setup>.

- If you are compiling directly from the UVMC_HOME/lib directory, the
Makefile uses default paths for UVMC_HOME, UVMC_LIB, and UVM_LIB. In this
case, you need only define UVM_HOME via environment variable or make
command line argument.

To compile the UVM and UVMC libraries for both 32 and 64-bit Linux

| > cd $UVMC_HOME/lib
| > make clean all

This cleans out any previously compiled libraries then builds the 32 and
64-bit libraries for both UVM and UVMC.

To build only 32 or only 64 bit libraries replace ~all~ with ~lib32~ or
~lib64~. 

| > cd $UVMC_HOME/lib
| > make clean lib32

Presently, the Makefile is geared for Questa compilation on Linux
platforms. If you need to compile on Windows or for another simulator,
modifications to this and the example Makefiles are expected.


Topic: SV TLM Limitations
-------------------------

TLM2 features not fully implemented in UVM

- Transport debug interface - tlm_transport_dbg_if

- Direct member interface - tlm_fw_direct_mem_if, tlm_bw_direct_mem_if

- Core initiator and target sockets - UVM provides sockets that provide
  blocking or non-blocking transport, but not both.

- Quantum keeper

- Payload event queue

- Instance-specific extensions

Should your SC models rely on SV-side implementation of these interfaces,
further adaptation may be required to achieve successful interoperability.

There are also several limitations in the current UVM implementation.

- The core sockets in standard TLM2, ~tlm_initiator_socket~ and
  ~tlm_target_socket~, have no direct counterpart in UVM SV. The standard
  defines initiator and target sockets that use/implement both the b_transport
  and nb_transport interfaces. UVM defines sockets that implement either
  blocking or non-blocking but not both. UVM Connect will still allow
  connections from SC initiator sockets to SV target UVM sockets, but a
  run-time fatal error will occur if a blocking call is made to a
  non-blocking UVM socket (e.g.  uvm_tlm_nb_target_socket) or a
  non-blocking call is made to a blocking UVM socket
  (e.g. uvm_tlm_b_target_socket).  Refer to Mantis 3682 
  (http://www.eda.org/svdb/view.php?id=3682)

- The ~uvm_tlm_generic_payload~ needs several fixes. Refer to
  (http://www.eda.org/svdb/view.php?id=3983)

- UVM does not fully implement TLM1 non-blocking interfaces. The ~ok_to_put~,
  ~ok_to_get~, and ~ok_to_peek~ methods are defined in the standard to return an
  event that is triggered once the non-blocking port is able to complete a put,
  get, or peek operation, respectively. Calls to these interface methods by
  connected SC-side ports will produce a run-time error and return an event
  that will never trigger.


Topic: Starting SC & SV
-----------------------

Issues associated with starting SystemC and SystemVerilog

SystemC typically elaborates and begins simulation before SystemVerilog has
completed elaboration. If the SC side attempts to communicate with
SystemVerilog too early, you may get run-time errors or undefined behavior.
SC-side ports that are bound to SV-side exports or imps are especially
vulnerable to this condition. UVM Connect tries to prevent this from
happening in two different ways:

- All UVM Command functions block until SV is ready

- All SC-side calls to TLM ports that are registered for connection across
  the language boundary will block until its cross-language connection
  is made.

The implication is that UVMC TLM and Command calls must be made from an
SC thread process.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group: About the Examples

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes how to run the examples included in this kit.
The examples show how UVMC can be used to integrate IP in a mixed SC and
SV environment, without modifying existing IP.

Before attempting to run the examples, be sure to review the <Getting Started>
section. Check for support for your platform, confirm that the UVM and UVMC
libraries are compiled, and make sure your environment variables are set
properly. 


Topic: Categories
-----------------

The UVM Connect kit provides examples in four major categories--connections,
converters, field type support, and UVM commands

Connections - Shows how to establish TLM connections across the language
             boundary. If you are not using the TLM generic payload 
             transaction type, you will also need to define a converter for
             your transaction.  See <Connection Examples>

Converters - Provides examples of writing (or generating) transaction
             converters. See <Converter Examples>

Field Types - Shows how to pack/unpack each data type that can be
             declared members (properties, or fields) of your transaction.
             See <Type-Support Examples>

UVM Commands - Demonstrates use of the UVM Command API for accessing and
             controlling UVM simulation from SystemC. For example, you can
             set configuration, override the factory, issue reports, and
             control phase progression from outside SV using this API.
             See <UVM Command Examples>



Topic: How to Run
-----------------

All examples can be found in the ~$UVMC_HOME/examples~ directory.
Before attempting to run any example, be sure you have prepared your
environment and compiled the UVM and UVMC libraries. See <Getting Started>
for how to do this.

To run the examples, ~cd~ into the examples directory for the category of
your choice (connections, converters, commands, field_types). Then type
~make~ or ~make help~ to get a menu of examples to run in that category.

Most examples utilize a common set of simple producer, consumer, and
scoreboard models. The models use standard SystemC / UVM coding guidelines
and provide standard TLM ports and exports for external communication.
None of the models contain references to UVM Connect or any other external
context, which is as it should be.

To run an individual example, ~cd~ into the examples directory
of your choice.

  |> cd $UVMC_HOME/examples/commands 

Type ~make~ without any arguments to get a list of all available examples
in that directory.

Then, select an example from the menu. For eaxmple:

  |> make phasing

This runs the 'phasing' example with the UVM source location defined by
the ~UVM_HOME~ environment variable and the UVM and UVMC compiled
libraries at their default location, ~../../lib/uvmc_lib~.

To run all ~UVM Command~ examples

  |> make all

The ~clean~ target deletes all the simulation files produced from previous
runs.

  |> make clean

You can also combine targets in one command line

  |> make clean reporting



Mind your ENV:

It is important that you use the same value for UVM_HOME and UVMC_HOME
for compiling and running examples as for compiling the libraries
themselves.  The best way to ensure this is to define the environment
variables once, perhaps using a shell script or .cshrc file.

  | > source my_uvmc_setup.sh
  | Setting required UVM and UVMC environment variables...
  |
  | > cd $UVMC_HOME/lib
  | > make clean all
  | >
  | > cd ../examples/commands
  | > make all
  | > cd ../converters
  | > make all
  | > ...


Running the examples outside the install tree:

To run the examples outside the UVMC_HOME install tree, all four 
environment variables must be defined either as environment variables
or via the ~make~ command line. See <Getting Started> for details.

Each example directory relies on a master Makefile in the root examples
directory. Copy the entire examples directory from the install location
into a local, writable area, perhaps in your HOME directory or a shared
workspace. Then ~cd~ to any subdirectory and run ~make~ as before.
